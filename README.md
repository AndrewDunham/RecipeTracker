# RecipeTracker
A program to store recipes, ingredient prices and time to make them.

TO DO:
- Write a Python script to do the querying/searching
- Create our own database with our **specially curated** recipes

## How we plan to execute this:
### 1. Get input from a user for the name of the recipe
### 2. Search a database (json)
### 3. Display output from search
### 4. GUI referencing part 1
